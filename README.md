# 1 Billion Row Challenge

This is my implementation for the 1 Billion Row Challenge. \
I know the competition was for Java initially and that it have ended, but I wanted to join the fun. \
My implementation is in Golang/Go because, I'm much more familiar with it than I'm with Java.

## Constraints

The temperatures are between -99.9 and 99.9 and they have exactly one fractional digit. \
Rounding should be done using the semantics of IEEE 754 with a rounding direction 'round toward positive'. \
Each station name is less than or equal to 100 bytes long while they are at most 10000 unique stations in the file.

## Results

Fastest run of my current program is 24s for the 1 billion lines file.
