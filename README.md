# 1 Billion Row Challenge

## Description

This is my implementation for the 1 Billion Row Challenge. \
I know the competition was for Java initially and that it have ended, but I wanted to join the fun. \
My implementation is in Golang/Go because, I'm much more familiar with it than I'm with Java. \
